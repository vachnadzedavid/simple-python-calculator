My last A-Level project, i sadly had to retreat a year to retake my exams and get a social life beacause last year I was hospitalized for 2 months and didn't study much for my igcse also i cut a lot of classes so i would prefer to study in another school.
I will release more projects but they will not be related with A-Levels i will do more varity projects and try to create more complex things that i hope will guide people to find my codes helpful.

Thanks for all you're support guys!! Until we meet again. Farewell!
